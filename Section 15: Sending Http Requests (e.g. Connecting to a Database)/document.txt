1. Module Introduction
  some data mustbe managed centrally

  react apps runs in the browser og your user, any data changes only happen locally(and are only stored locally)
  clients communicate (send and fetch data) via HTTP request

  DataFetching and HTTP requests:
      -- sending & receiving data via HTTP
  --->How to connect a backend/database
  ---> fetching data
  ---> sending data


2. How (Not) To Connect To A Database:
    don't connect your react App to a database
      your react code runs in the browser of your user 
      they can view that code (via the browser developer tools) if they want to!

  There are also technical restrictions & constraints
      not all operations can be performed in the browser
      instaed communicate with a hack-end server instaed

      frontend: <------HTTP Request------> backend
        frontend: runs in the user's browser, users can theoritically view the entire code
        backend: runs on a seperate (inaccessible) server, backend code can interact with database etc.,


3. How NOT To Send HTTP Requests (And Why It's Wrong):
