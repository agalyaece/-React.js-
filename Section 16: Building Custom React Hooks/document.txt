1. Module Introduction & Starting Project
    -creating and using React Hooks:
      1. Repetition: rules of hook
      2. Why custom hooks?
      3. creating custom Hooks
      4. using Custom Hooks

2. Revisiting the "Rules of Hooks" & Why To Use Hooks
        1. only call hooks in component or other hook function
              must not be called outside of react component function or other hook function
        2. only call hooks on the top level
              must not be called in nested code statements(eg: inside if-statement)

      makes code more generic and can reuse it 
      one reusable and configurable function

3. Creating a Custom Hook
        1. create a seperate file for hook that has to be customised
        2. creating a standard function and the name starts with use
                function usenameOfCustomHook(){}

4. Custom Hook: Managing State & Returning State Values
    the logic for managing those different built-in hooks like useState, useEffct and HTTP request all lives inside the custom hooks
    in our component we can simply use that custom hook and we get all behaviour and functionality of the hook
