1. Module Introduction
      exploring advanced react patterns and repeating key best practices
          1. common patterns and practices
          2. compound components, render props and more
          3. applied to demo project

2. Introducing Compound Components
            multiple components that don't work standalone but instead together
          for using dropdown menu like accordian component

3.  Managing Multi-Component State with the Context API
            merge all component identifiers into one object
            uses main wrapping objects

4. Introducing & Using Render Props
            passing a function as value for the children prop
        for searching option and includes search logic

5.  Implementing a Search Functionality With Help Of Render Props
            render props allows the complete rendering props
            how something should be rendered out of the components

6. Working with Debouncing
          Debouncing is a technique where we don't update a state on every keystroke
            but instead to find some timing threshold to update where the user stops typing for specified milliseconds
